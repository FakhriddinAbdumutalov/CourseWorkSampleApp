# Course Work Sample App

This is an ordinary app written in nodejs for course work.
First, I have creaated the exact same code as the seminar 7 course work sample. And I learned this carefully, (what code for what, how this code works, how they connected to each other and etc.) 
So from gainded knowledge of the code I changed some parts of the code and created a style to make it beautifull and also did some minor changes to the code.
I also changed some comments on the code and created my own comments on almost all of the code to make it pretty understandable for people and myself as well.
